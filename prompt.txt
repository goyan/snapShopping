ANDROID APP BUILD PROMPT (FRIDGE SCAN)

You are a senior Android developer and AI engineer.
Build an Android application (Kotlin, Jetpack Compose) that allows users to take a photo of their refrigerator and automatically extract a structured list of food items using AI vision.

Core Features

Camera integration

Use CameraX

Allow taking multiple photos (top shelf, bottom shelf, door)

Optional gallery import

AI image analysis

Send the photo(s) to an AI Vision API (Google ML Kit / OpenAI Vision / Gemini)

Detect food items only (ignore plates, bottles without labels, containers)

Return results as structured JSON:

{
  "items": [
    {
      "name": "milk",
      "category": "dairy",
      "confidence": 0.92
    }
  ]
}


Post-processing logic

Merge duplicates (e.g. “cheese” + “cheddar”)

Normalize names (plural → singular)

Remove low-confidence items (<0.6)

Inventory screen

Editable list of detected items

Add / remove / rename items

Optional quantity field

Local storage

Use Room database

Persist inventory between sessions

UI

Jetpack Compose

Minimal clean design

Loading + error states

Architecture

MVVM

Repository pattern

Coroutines + Flow

Dependency Injection (Hilt)

Security & Performance

API key stored securely

Compress images before upload

Offline fallback: manual input if AI fails

Deliverables

Full project structure

Key Kotlin files

Vision API integration example

Example prompt sent to the Vision model

Instructions to run on Android Studio

Assume this is an MVP that can be extended later with:

Expiration date detection

Recipe suggestions

Cloud sync

🧠 OPTIONAL: VISION MODEL PROMPT (VERY IMPORTANT)

Use this prompt when sending images to the AI vision model:

Analyze the image of a refrigerator.
List only visible food items.
Ignore containers, plates, and non-food objects.
Use generic food names.
Return a JSON array with:
- name
- food category
- confidence score (0–1)
Do not include explanations or text outside JSON.
